Once the app.py file is executed, you will be asked to provide the path for the csv file containing all the loans. After that you will be asked to input your credit score, current monthly debt, total monthly income, desired loan amount, and the home value. Shortly after it will spill out your monthly debt to income ratio, loan to value ratio, and the amount of loans you qualify for. You will be met with the option of saving all the loans you qualify for to a csv file, which can later be used to compare and contrast all the different loans.
